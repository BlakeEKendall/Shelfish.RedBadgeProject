<p>Shelfish was created as a final Red Badge project for the Eleven Fifty Academy's Software Development course by Blake Kendall. 
    Inspired by apps like Goodreads, and always needing a way to keep track of what books he's read or hoping to read in the future, 
    Blake hopes you can find this useful for whatever kind of reader you are.
