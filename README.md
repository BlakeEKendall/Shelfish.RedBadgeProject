## General info
Shelfish was initally created to help me organize my own book collection. 
Whether reading for fun, or doing research or schoolwork, a good way to organize your books is always important!

## Technologies
* Tech 1 - version 1.0:
* .Net Framework v4.8
* Bootstrap 4.5
* HTML/CSS 5
* ASP.Net MVC
* Visual Studio Community
* Microsoft Azure
 

## Setup
Clone or download a copy from the Github repository page to your local computer/repository. 
Make sure you are using .Net Framework v4.8, download & install if needed.
It might also be necessary to check your nuGet packages, and make sure everything is using the most current/stable version.
Open the file in Visual Studio or your preferred coding program, and click start/run. Now you can use it on your local computer/database! 
Note: No migrations or database seed necessary at this time.

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development

To-do list:

## Status
Project is: finished! For now, at least. With more time and tinkering, I would like to implement improvements as I can to improve my skills and continue learning.

## Inspiration
Project was inspired by apps like Goodreads. Special thanks to Matt Artz on Unsplash.com for his photo of a blue shelf on a yellow-painted wall that I used on my Homepage.
Thank you also to Lithub.com for their RSS feed, and to Surfing-Waves.com for their RSS widget used on my Home Page.
Thank you to Rita ≈Åyczywek for her article on writing a good README file on bulldogjob.com that gave me this outline.
And thank you to my class instructors for their patience and encouragement, for believing in me and my ability to finish and keep working, especially when things got frustrating and difficult.
